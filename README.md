# Email-Spam-Classifier
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of 
automatically classifying SMS text messages as either spam or ham 
(legitimate). With the rise of digital communication, spam messages have 
become a major nuisance, leading to wasted time, potential scams, and even 
security threats. Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, we aim to train 
machine learning models that can distinguish between useful and unwanted 
messages based on the textual patterns found in them. This involves cleaning 
the data, analyzing message patterns, extracting important features, and building 
efficient classification models. Ultimately, the system should be able to predict 
whether a message is spam with high accuracy, helping to improve user 
experience and communication security.
